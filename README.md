# CNN-text-classification-keras

It is implementation of [Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in TensorFlow](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/) in Keras as functional api Also it use 10-folding cross-validation and early stop
# Requirements
- [Python 3.5.2](https://www.python.org/)
- [Keras 2.1.2](http://keras.io/)
- [Tensorflow 1.4.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

# Traning
Run the below command and it will run for 100 epochs if you want change it just open model.py
`python model.py`
You can run rnn implementation version
`python model_rnn.py`

# For new data
You have to rebuild the vocabulary and then train.
